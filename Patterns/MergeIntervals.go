//Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

// Example 1:
// Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
// Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
// Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

// Example 2:
// Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
// Output: [[1,5]]
// Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

//Note, DO NOT use quicksort for intervals, this is because quicksort intervals is unstable.

//Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]

//Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
